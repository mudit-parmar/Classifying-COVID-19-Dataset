# Classifying-COVID-19-Dataset

The dataset describes various information about the population and Covid pandemic situation in 50 US States and over each day of the month of January 2021. Each record gives Covid information for that day and demographic data for the whole state as well. Note the demographic data is duplicated for each state since for all days since it doesn't change that quickly and is based on data from the last census. Also note that the data was combined together from multiple sources and not processed for uniform number formats and was not normalized.The data has no missing data, but there are certainly some states which more extreme values than others, so consideration of outliers is reasonable. All of this will be initial pre-processing needed to carry out.
